# Diverse mini-batch Active Learning (DBAL)
My implementation for the deep active learning query strategy DBAL based on the paper [Diverse mini-batch Active Learning from Fedor Zhdanov](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1901.05954)

This code goes with the blog post [How to Train Neural Networks With Fewer Data Using Active Learning](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/how-to-train-neural-networks-with-fewer-data-using-active-learning-445154c30ddf)

## Installation
Using Python3.9+ `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
In main.py set the `image_path` to a folder containing images and adjust the DBAL parameters.
Then run `python main.py`
